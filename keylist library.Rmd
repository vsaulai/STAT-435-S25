```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This list is mainly used to combine all operators, functions, and useful commands in R primarily for practicing in class. Note some straightforward elements I have not put here.

## Accessibility
ls() -  shows all current objects in your environment
rm(object_name) -	 Removes a specific object from the environment.
rm(list = ls()) - 	Clears all objects from the environment.
getwd() -	 Gets the current working directory.
setwd("path/to/directory") - 	Sets the working directory.
dir() or list.files() - 	Lists all files in the current directory.

?function_name -	Shortcut for the help() function.
example(function_name) -	Shows an example usage of a function.
str(object) -	 Displays the structure of an object.

## Handling Data

## R Logical Operators
&   Element-wise Logical AND operator. Returns TRUE if both elements are TRUE.
&&  Logical AND operator = Returns TRUE if both statements are TRUE.
|   Element-wise Logical OR operator. Returns TRUE if one of the statements is TRUE.
||  Logical OR operator. Returns TRUE if one of the statements is TRUE.
!   Logical NOT - Returns FALSE if statement is TRUE

## Escape Characters
\   This denotes a character that is followed by another character that is typically illegal that you would want to insert inside a string.
\\	Backslash
\n	New Line
\r	Carriage Return
\t	Tab
\b	Backspace
\
## R Miscellaneous Operators
:   Creates a series of numbers in a sequence   "x <- 1:10"

library(ggplot2) #animated visuals
library(ggrepel) #prevent overlapping text labels in ggplot2
library(gganimate) #create animated visuals in ggplot
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(gapminder) #for some data
library(gifski) #creation of gifs, could also use library(png)
library(lubridate) #working with time variables
library(maps) #for mapping with ggplot
library(mapdata) #for mapping with ggplot
library(transformr) #for changing chloropleths across time
library(ggthemes) #extra color options

```

## Conditionals
if (Boolean_conditional) { <body> } -- An "if statement" that only executes if the condition boolean is TRUE.
else if (Boolean_conditional) { <body> } -- A statement "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition"

## Loops
while (Boolean_condition) { <body> } -- A loop that executes a set of statements as long as a condition is TRUE.
  break -- statement that can stop a loop even if the condition is TRUE.
  next  -- skips an iteration without terminating the loop
for (variable in sequence) {   - variable: the loop variable that takes on each value in the sequence
  <# Code to execute>}  - sequence: A collection of values (vectors, lists, or ranges) that the loop will iterate over

## Data Structures
Vector - A one-dimensional data structure that is homogeneous(i.e., all elements must be of the same data type)
      temp <- c(1,2,3,4) -- defining a vector starts with the concatenate function.
          indexing- addressing certain elements within a vector or matrix using a bracket [] (note. arguments differ for )
              vector_name[index] - position of the element within a vector that you want to access
              df[["column_name"]] - data frame accessing
              print(df$rowname) - accessing by column or specific name type
              subset() - accessing a data frame with certain conditions
          comparing vectors
             use identical() or all.equal()

Matrix - A two-dimensional data structure that is also homogeneous (i.e., all elements must be of the same data type)
      matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) - arguments for making a matrix from a sequence with rows and columns defined.
        colSums(), rowSums() - if specified on a matrix, immediately "squishes" the columns or rows into the dimensions of the table.
        
sometimes it is ideal to make any subset of data another object instead of the initial thing.  
        
Array - A multi-dimensional data structure that can be 3D or 4D
      array(), arguments "array(<data>, dim = c(x,y,z)) - where dimensions can be predefined while creating an array
Data Frame - A two-dimensional table-like structure containing multiple types of different data types. Works similar to a spreadsheet.
      data.frame() - can define columns with different data types with this argument

## Data Manipulation

## Escape Sequences (Special Characters)

\n	New line
\t	Tab
\\	Backslash \
\"	Double quote " inside a string
\'	Single quote ' inside a string
\\d  represents digits, inside a string
\s  represents white space, inside a string
^    start of the string
\\s* none or  more white space
$   end of string

## Github

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Advanced Git

+ branching: you can maintain "parallel" versions of your repository.
This is useful for "exploratory" work. These can later be merged into
the "main" branch.
+ bisecting: you can identify the commit responsible for introducing a
bug using binary search
+ hooks: you can automatically execute tasks based upon git behaviors;
can be used to automate testing/deployment
